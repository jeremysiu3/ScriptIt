# transliteration

This project allows users to convert Latin script using standard romanization to the language script of their choice (Bengali, Greek, Hindi, Japanese, Javanese, Korean, Mandarin, Russian).

In this project, I also learned how to use Git, and I didn't start doing it until I was well into the project so there are some missing files (also the commit message saying poopy).
